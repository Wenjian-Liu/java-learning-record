Topic: Collections Basics — Collection API, List vs Set  
Status: ✅ Done

What I learned / practiced

Understood Collection as the common interface for element containers.

Compared List vs Set:

List: ordered, allows duplicates, index-based.

Set: no duplicates, uniqueness relies on equals() + hashCode().

Practiced core Collection methods:

add, size, remove, isEmpty, clear, contains, toArray

Skipped advanced overload toArray(String[]::new) for now (will revisit with generics/method references).

Output

Implemented CollectionDemo1.java, CollectionDemo2.java.
