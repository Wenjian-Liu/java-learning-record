# Day28 - 2025/12/25

## Focus
- Consolidated understanding of `Object.equals` semantics.

## What I worked on
- Rebuilt the equals implementation flow without referencing existing code.
- Identified common mistakes during self-generation:
  - confusing `==` with `equals`
  - missing type cast after `instanceof`
  - mixing constructor parameters with object state
  - overthinking getter/setter usage in internal comparison

## Notes
- Code was intentionally not committed due to structural messiness.
- Prioritized conceptual clarity over version history cleanliness.

## Status
- Consolidation day, no feature delivery.
