# Day26 – 2025/12/23  
## Java Learning Log

### 📌 Learning Focus
- Refactored yesterday’s user-system case to **reduce coupling (解耦)**.
- Followed tutorial refactor steps; applied extraction to improve structure.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Decoupling makes layers/components easier to change independently.
- Extracted responsibilities into dedicated methods/classes to improve readability and maintainability.
- Observed how UI/Service/DAO boundaries become clearer after refactor.

### 💻 Practice
- Updated user-system code by refactoring (no new features).
- Main flow reorganized to centralize program entry and delegate responsibilities.

### ❓Open Questions
- Still unclear on: why certain parts were extracted and why `main` is structured that way.
- Will revisit the refactor with a “before vs after” comparison and draw call flow.
