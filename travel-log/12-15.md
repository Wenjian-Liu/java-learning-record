## Travel Mode · Java Learning Log

### 📌 Learning Focus
- Watched Heima Java OOP video: **Parent Class Constructors (父类构造方法)**

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Subclass constructors must invoke a parent constructor (`super(...)`) before initializing subclass fields.
- If a parent class defines only parameterized constructors, subclasses must explicitly call `super(...)`.
- Constructor chaining ensures proper object initialization order (parent → child).
- Reinforced understanding using previously implemented `Product / PhysicalProduct / DigitalProduct` hierarchy.

### 💻 Practice
- No new code written today.
- Constructor logic already implemented in existing Product-related classes.

### 🌍 Notes
- Travel mode day: focused on consolidating OOP fundamentals rather than writing new code.
- Strengthened understanding of constructor chaining and inheritance design.

✅ Daily check-in completed.
