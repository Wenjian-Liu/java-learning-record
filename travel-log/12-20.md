## Java Learning Log

### 📌 Learning Focus
- Reviewed existing OOP implementation: **Product / PhysicalProduct / DigitalProduct**

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Revisited class hierarchy and constructor chaining logic.
- Reinforced understanding of:
  - Encapsulation via private fields and getters
  - Inheritance and `super(...)` usage
  - Polymorphic behavior through parent-type references
- Reflected on extensibility:
  - Considered how current design would support adding new product types.

### 💻 Practice
- No new code written.
- Focused on code review and design-level reflection of previously implemented examples.

### 🌍 Notes
- Transition day from travel mode to normal study rhythm.
- Prioritized rebuilding context and design understanding over new content intake.

✅ Daily check-in completed.
