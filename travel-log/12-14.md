## Travel Mode · Java Learning Log

### 📌 Learning Focus
- Watched Heima Java OOP video: **Reducing Coupling (降低耦合)**

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Lower coupling improves maintainability and extensibility.
- Prefer **programming to abstractions (父类 / 接口)** rather than concrete implementations.
- Reduce dependency on specific subclasses by using polymorphism.
- Avoid excessive `instanceof` logic; move behavior into subclasses where possible.

### 💻 Practice
- No new code written today.
- Related salary and polymorphism demos have been committed previously.

### 🌍 Notes
- Travel day: learning focused on conceptual understanding rather than coding.
- Maintained daily learning continuity during travel.

✅ Daily check-in completed.
